## Reporting a Vulnerability

In order to communicate with us about your concern, please email us at
[team@innovation.nj.gov](team@innovation.nj.gov). We value the input of all submitted reports and
are committed to maintaining the highest level of security for our systems. If you choose to use
this method, we will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and begin a response
process.

Once we have begun our investigation, we aim to provide regular updates on the status of the
vulnerability via email or as required by law in accordance with state and federal regulations.
Please be aware that while we strive for complete transparency, some details may need to remain
confidential in order to protect both you and us from potential legal ramifications.

If your report is accepted as a security vulnerability, our team will take steps to remediate the
issue. We also expect that there could be an impact on our operations or systems; in such cases, we
will provide you with details about potential impacts. Please note that we prioritize all reports of
this nature and strive for prompt mitigation.

On the other hand, if your report is declined as a security vulnerability, rest assured that it is
not something we have concerns about or plan to address. However, we are open to feedback and
suggestions on how we can better protect our systems in the future.

Thank you for helping us maintain high standards of security within our organization. We appreciate
your efforts in keeping our systems secure. If there's anything else you need help with, please feel
free to contact us anytime.
